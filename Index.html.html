               <h3>About Dogs</h3>
                <p>Dogs are lovable creatures that we have grown to love.The dog or domestic dog, is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
                     The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, as well as the modern grey wolf which is known as the dog's nearest living relative.
               </br>
                    The scientific name for dogs is Canis familiaris which means a member of the genus Canis (probably descended from the common wolf) that has been domesticated by man since prehistoric times
                    Dogs are therefore classified as omnivores as well as mammals.In the wild, dogs have an average life span of 12 years but depending on the type of breed it is ,typically 10 – 13 years in domestication.
              </br>
                    As mentioned before, there are a lot of different dog breeds.According to The AKC[<a href="https://www.akc.org/"> American Kennel Club</a>] there are currently 197 dog breeds registered, while the FCI [<a href ="http://www.fci.be/en/">Federation Cynologique International </a>] recognizes 360 breeds officially.
                    Then, there are all the experimental breeds. So there isn’t an exact, worldwide, internationally agreed-upon number, but it would be safe to say there are anywhere between 195 and 500 dog breeds in the world.
